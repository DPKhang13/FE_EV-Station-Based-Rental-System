✅ Fix: Variant format issue resolved

## Changes:
- Cleaned up workaround code in vehicleService.js
- Removed debug logs in StationManagement.jsx  
- Kept formatVariant utility for display formatting
- Updated documentation to mark as RESOLVED

## Issue:
Backend was lowercasing variant ("plus" instead of "Plus")

## Solution:
Backend team fixed ValidationUtil.java:
- Added normalizeVariant() method
- Updated validateVariantBySeatCount()
- Database migration completed

## Result:
✅ Database now stores: "Plus", "Air", "Pro"
✅ Frontend displays correctly
✅ No more console warnings
